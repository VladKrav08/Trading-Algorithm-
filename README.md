Brownian Motion Risk Model and Trading Framework

This repository contains a small, transparent Python project that explores how Brownian motion and simple technical rules can be used to study market behavior. It includes a basic GBM simulation module, a backtesting script, and optional paper trading through the Alpaca API. This project is for learning only. It is not investment advice.

What this project includes:
	A Moving Average Crossover rule (20 vs 50),
	ATR-based stop loss and take profit logic,
	volatility scaled position sizing with fixed percentage risk per trade,
	optional daily loss cap,
	backtesting on CSV price data,
	optional paper trading mode through Alpaca API,
	a Brownian motion module that demonstrates how randomness is modeled in finance.
